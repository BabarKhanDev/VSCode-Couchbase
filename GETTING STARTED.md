# Getting Started

For now the database browswer is unfinished, but feel free to use the snippets that are implemented. 

To install the VSIX file do the following:

1. Download the latest VSIX file at our [releases page](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/VSCode-Couchbase/releases). 
    *Note: We are currently in pre release mode so there may be some bugs*

2. Open Visual Studio Code.

3. On the left side of the screen you will see a menu bar with an option to open the extensions menu, click this button.

4. You should now see the extensions menu. At the top right of this menu you should see an ellipsis menu icon, click this and select "Install from VSIX".

5. This should open a file explorer, locate the VSIX that you downloaded earlier and install it.  

6. Congratulations, you have now installed the Couchbase Visual Studio Code Extension.
